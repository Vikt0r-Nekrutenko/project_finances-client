# Project Finances Client

**About**

It's a terminal application for tracking my finance operations. This is 'client-side' application based on Qt and STF.</br>
From 2020 i'm using the Google sheets for this task, but now time to "real tracking" :)</br>
![project-finance-server](https://github.com/Vikt0r-Nekrutenko/project-finances-server) <- watch of my server-side part.
